### Notes

I was finding that for some of my work I just needed more RAM to do what I needed to do. 
On *paper* the motherboard states it only supports a maximum of 128GB of RAM, however during
research I found that silently the motherboard would support 4x 48GB RAM sticks, just at a lower speed.

E.g. now I'm running the 4 RAM slots at 3600 MT/s rather than their max speed of 5600 MT/s, 
however this lets me get much more RAM for my projects which has been needed as of late.
